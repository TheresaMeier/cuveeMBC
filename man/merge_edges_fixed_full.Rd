\title{Merge vine structures for hierarchical copula (fixed spatial structure)}
\usage{
merge_edges_fixed_full(rvs_level1, rvs_level2, bridge_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{rvs_level1}{R-vine structure object for spatial dependence (to be replicated)}

\item{rvs_level2}{R-vine structure object for inter-variable dependence (single structure)}

\item{bridge_var}{Integer. Location index used to connect the two hierarchies.}
}
\value{
Merged R-vine structure (rvs_level3) combining spatial and inter-variable
dependence with variables properly ordered.
}
\description{
Combines level 1 (spatial dependence within variables) and level 2
(inter-variable dependence) R-vine structures into a single unified structure
using a fixed spatial structure approach. The level 2 structure is replicated
across variables, then merged with the level 1 structure using a bridging variable.
}
\details{
This function replicates the level 2 structure across all spatial locations,
then transforms both structures to a common natural ordering before merging.
The bridge variable anchors the connection between the two levels.
