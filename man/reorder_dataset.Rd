\usage{
reorder_dataset(
  data,
  direction = c("variable-major", "location-major"),
  order = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with columns named as "variable.location", e.g. "tas.1" or "tas.loc1"}

\item{direction}{Reordering strategy: "variable-major" or "location-major"}

\item{order}{Optional: Integer vector specifying a custom variable order}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns reordered according to the selected strategy
}
\description{
Reorganizes columns of a dataset that follows a "variable.location"
naming convention (e.g. "tas.1", "tas.2", "pr.1" etc.). The function allows
switching between variable-major and location-major layouts.

Two ordering strategies are supported:
\itemize{
\item variable-major : all locations for each variable are grouped together
\item location-major : all variables for each location are grouped together
}
}
