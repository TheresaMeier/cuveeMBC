\title{Merge vine structures for hierarchical copula (individual spatial structures)}
\usage{
merge_edges_individual_full(rvs_level1, rvs_level2, bridge_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{rvs_level1}{List of R-vine structure objects for spatial dependence
(one structure per variable)}

\item{rvs_level2}{List of R-vine structure objects for inter-variable dependence}

\item{bridge_var}{Integer. Location index used to connect the hierarchies.}
}
\value{
Merged R-vine structure (rvs_level3) combining spatial and inter-variable
dependence with variables properly ordered.
}
\description{
Combines level 1 (spatial dependence within variables) and level
2 (inter-variable dependence) R-vine structures into a single unified structure
using an individual spatial structure approach. Unlike the fixed version, each
variable can have its own level 1 structure. Level 2 structures are replicated
and merged with their corresponding level 1 structures.
}
\details{
This function handles variable-specific level 1 structures by replicating
each corresponding level 2 structure, then transforming both to natural
ordering before merging. The bridge variable anchors the connection between
the two levels.
